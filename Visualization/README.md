# üñºÔ∏è Memory Visualization

We embrace the "A picture is worth a thousand words" approach and wrote a couple of scripts to visualize how the memory is populated in different scenarios.

## üåä Overflow Simulation

In the [`overflow_simulation.c`](overflow_simulation.c) script, we simulate the behaviour of the `set_cmnd()` function inside sudo in order to understand how the backslash at the end of the arguments string can affect memory population and thus explain the occuring overflow.

## üåê Environment Variables

In the [`envp_simulation.c`](envp_simulation.c) script, we simulate the same behaviour as before but this time we add an environment variable, in order to see where it get stored in the memory. This will be particularly useful when crafting the exploit.
