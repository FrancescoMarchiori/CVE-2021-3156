## üß© Abstract

Any Unix-based Operating System is equipped with the sudo command that allows for a temporary root privileges escalation for those users that are expected to do so. Sudo offers then a critical functionality that if abused may lead to the compromise of the security and reliability of the system itself. Because of its importance within the Operating System, sudo‚Äôs source code is subject to frequent testing and code reviews. These have led to discover a heap-based overflow vulnerability, named as CVE-2021-3156, that surprisingly has been hidden for almost 10 years. Neither fuzzing techniques, one of the most used techniques for bug and vulnerability discovery, allowed to spot out it before. In this paper, we analyze in detail the CVE-2021-3156 sudo vulnerability, starting from the buffer overflow vulnerability up to how it can be exploited in order to gain a root shell even being a non-privileged user or not being allowed to use the sudo command.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualization

In the [`Visualization`](https://github.com/FrancescoMarchiori/CVE-2021-3156/tree/main/Visualization) directory there are a couple of script that we used to visualize how arguments are parsed with or without backslash characters and to analyze how environment variables affect the heap layout, in order to further understand the structure of the proposed exploit.

## üîç Fuzzing

In the [`Fuzzing`](https://github.com/FrancescoMarchiori/CVE-2021-3156/tree/main/Fuzzing) directory there are the files needed to perform fuzzing on the vulnerable version of sudo. It's also reported how to be able to fuzz and how to solve the problems that prevent [AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL) to work out-of-the-box, thus explaining how the vulnerability has been hidden for almost 10 years.
